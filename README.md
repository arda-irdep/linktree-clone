Linktree clone made with HTML and CSS

I'm excited to share my Linktree clone with you. As a developer, I understand the importance of having all of my links in one convenient place, and that's exactly what my clone allows you to do.

With my Linktree clone, you can easily access all of my links, including my resume, which is available for download. I've designed the clone with simplicity and ease of use in mind, so you can quickly find what you're looking for and get on with your day.

I built the clone using HTML and CSS, I hope you find it helpful and user-friendly.

If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'd love to hear your thoughts and make any necessary improvements.
